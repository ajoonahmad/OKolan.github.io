      <p>
      The Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família 
      is the largest unfinished Roman Catholic church in the world located in Barcelona.
      Designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926).
      Gaudí's work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, 
      and in November 2010 Pope Benedict XVI consecrated and proclaimed it a minor 
      basilica, as distinct from a cathedral, which must be the seat of a bishop.

      <p>
      The Gothic Quarter is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. 
      It stretches from La Rambla to Via Laietana, and from the Mediterranean seafront 
      to the Ronda de Sant Pere. It is a part of Ciutat Vella district.
      The quarter encompasses the oldest parts of the city of Barcelona, 
      and includes the remains of the city's Roman wall and several notable medieval landmarks. 
      The Barri Gòtic retains a labyrinthine street plan, with many small streets opening out into squares. 
      Most of the quarter is closed to regular traffic although open to service vehicles and taxis.
